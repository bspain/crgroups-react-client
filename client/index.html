We are reading through the book \"Kingdom Calling\" by Amy Sherman while also praying, supporting, and encouraging one another in this chaotic pandemic season. This is a continuation of the group, but it is no problem for anyone to jump in midway as the conversation flows even if not everyone has read the book or participated yet."

Each meeting will have a job transition related devotional, followed by time spent in large group networking, and then ending by breaking into prayer circles to help support you during the transition.\nAll are welcome to join this group on whatever Thursday works best for you."
